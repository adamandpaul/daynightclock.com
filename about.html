    <h2>Definition</h2>

    <p>
      The Day Night Clock displays the amount of time left of the <strong>day</strong> until 6 pm (sunset), the
      clock then resets to display the amount of time left of the <strong>night</strong> until 6 am (sunrise).
    </p>

    <p>
      To represent daytime the clock displays "to set" or "ts" after time in a similar way to
      how "am" and "pm" are used. For example "7 am" on a regular clock would be "11 ts" on the
      Day Night Clock - meaning you've got 11 hours left of your day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nighttime is signified by "to rise" or "tr". For example "10 pm" would be "8 tr" on the
      Day Night Clock - time to get good night sleep.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Clock which counts down showing the time left until the next 6 am/pm. Written as the number or hours and minutes
      "to set" (6pm) or the number of hours and minutes "to rise" (6am)
    </p>

        </td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Note that "8:00 tr" is counted as the next day (Thursday) because the next "6 am" from "10 pm Wednesday"
      lands on a Thursday

      <h2>Why?</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Time is valuable, the Day Night Clock is designed to be useful for helping to understand our time each day to
      end that we might be more able to do the wise things each day. This was inspired by the Bible
      verse: "Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom." (Psalm 90) Though the clock doesn't
      deal with the time span of days - it is designed to make us aware of the quantity of time that we have in each day and how that passes.
    <p>
      To give an example, let's say the current time is "10 am". On the Day Night Clock the time would be "8 hours to set" or "8:00 ts" - meaning there are 8 hours left of the day. Both "10 am" and "8 ts" are measuring quantities relative to specific time of the day being "midnight" and "end of the day" respectively. However, there are a number of reasons why "8 ts" is a more important measurement:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's optimistic. "8 ts" is measuring what we have, rather than what we have already spent.</li>
      <li>It's aligned to common daily patterns. "End of the day" and "End of night" are a far more substantial events in our everyday lives rather than mid-night (for which most of us are asleep for) and mid-day.</li>
      <li>It's more natural. "End of day" and "end of night" are more natural divisions in the day being in the same region of the day associated with the rising and setting of the sun.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are numerous potential benefits that can be gained from such a clock.  For example, the clock doesn't
      give you more time, rather, there is a realisation about how little time we have. This may shock us initially
      and even give us some anxiety when we realise we attempt to do too many things in a day - that kind of shock
      is not bad, because such realisation will help us make better decisions and to plan what we value giving
      space to important things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only can the clock help us to be more focused - but it also has a more healthy approach to rest. The clock naturally divides the day into an active focused "day" and a calmed down "night" - this gives value and the needed space for rest too.

      <h2>
        Daylight Savings
      </h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Handling daylight savings will is to be consistent with the definition of the clock above. This means
      that the clock actually handles day light savings in a more consistent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When daylight savings starts and we lose an hour the clock will count down from 11 hours instead of 12 hours starting at 6pm the previous day. When daylight savings finishes we gain an hour and the clock will start counting down from 13 hours from 6pm the previous day.
